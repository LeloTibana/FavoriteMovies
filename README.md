# FavoriteMovies
This project is the hardest one I have done to date. In this project I have created a site where one can add movies with ratings and review and the movies are ordered on highest rating to lowest. I use the The Movie Database API to get the movie poster, and description. It's a flask-bootstrap site that uses SQLAlchemy to create a database that one can post, update and/or delete a record from.
